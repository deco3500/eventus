###Summary

Eventus is a mobile application which provides users with local event news, specifically event news in the music genre. The app is aimed more on the performance music events, for example, concerts, live bands and impromptu performances. Eventus is designed to break the barrier between users and events, the individual will no longer need to go out of their way to find information in local performances, instead they will have power of that knowledge at the touch of their finger. By using locational services on a user’s smart-device, Eventus will automatically retrieve information about current and upcoming nearby events based on the user’s location.


Ideally, the app would retrieve event information from local repositories that are already made available to the public or, they could be posted by admins. Security protocols are placed to test the authenticity of individuals applying for admin positions, this aims to provide a safe and reliable environment to users. After being authenticated individuals/organisers are granted admin privileges where they can post, edit and monitor events.  


###Concept

Eventus is a mobile application that allow users to retrieve information about current and upcoming nearby musical events around the user’s location. The events that are on offer cover genres such as performing arts, festivals, concerts and sporting events. By using the GPS function that’s available on the user’s smart-device, Eventus will automatically scan for nearby events to present to the user. 

####**Refined Target Audience**

After receiving some positive feedback on our previous ideas, we have decided to narrow down the genres Eventus offers. We have decided on the musical genre, to start out, we are targeting bands/djs/music events that targets anyone above the age of 18. As an example of how we obtain our information, I have chosen to do a small demonstration over the events available over Brisbane (links above). The purpose of Eventus is to simplify processes, minimise searching and maximising efficiency for users. This means the information that will be available in the app doesn’t necessarily have to be disclosed information that users can’t find on their own, in fact, the information that’s readily available for users are publicly announced information off the council website. With all that said, local clubs or pubs with impromptu performances could do a last minute announcement over the app allowing them to promote their event, an authorised representative would be required to post an announcement. 


By refining different genre in events, the date of the event and the cost of the event, this will break down the cluttered information given on the source websites where we would retrieve information from and regurgitate it to the public based on their locational settings. By developing a strong rapport and collaborating with individual local councils and individual local event broadcasters and bloggers, we intend to reach a system where information that are scheduled to be uploaded onto local council website will be provided to us before upload.

####**Source of Events**

Special musical events can be posted by event organisers, these organisers must be authenticated by passing several requirements before listing an event. The process requires Event organisers to provide the project officer’s contact details, with a link to their offered event. Once approved, the platform will provide a one time code to the project officer email or phone number, which will post the event the organiser uploaded prior. Apart from that, the app will gather data from trusted local sources, such as Eventbrite or the city council’s database.

####**Technical Concepts and Features**

The application will utilize geofencing technique, so if the user is near to the posted event’s location, the application will notify the user. The user can bookmark the event or even share it to the users through social networking applications, such as Facebook or Twitter. Users can see the detailed information and ratings regarding the event within the app. In addition, user can follow the updates of the bookmarked events. Updates will be sent real time to the users. Event organizer also can share promotional code through this application.  

####**Different Offerings with Other Competitors**

This application focuses on providing information of nearby musical events using the user’s current location. Comparing to other applications, such as Eventbrite, Eventus caters to the user by giving suggestions and offers. The app also takes into consideration the travel a user may need to make to the event. By allowing authenticated Event organisers to upload events, this creates an exclusivity effect on some last minute musical events which differs us from Eventbrite. This component will make sure users aren’t going to miss out on any potential event they might be interested in. Users can provide feedback on every event they’ve attended which also means, they can see the feedback on other events. Another major features of the application that makes it different with others are live streamming feature of an event and ability to see friends who will come to the nearby musical events.

###**Marketing**

The marketing of the app will be over the following channels.

Collaborating with event organizers and artistes: We will work with event organizers and artistes to encourage them to use our platform to broadcast their events. We will motive them to do so by stating the advantageous of doing so, mainly on the point that it would give their event more exposure especially catering for new visitors of the area who will be the ones that will be interested and have the time to attend these music events. We will also use their marketing channels, for example, placing our logo on their websites and posters to help our app to be more visible. 

Website: We will create a landing page for our app. In the form of a landing page and utilizing search engine optimization (SEO) to push our page up on search results linked to music related events. The website will inform people of the opportunity to download our app from either Android or Apple app stores and use it to find out more information of events near them and enable them to have a peek at the performances if they currently on.

Google Adwords: Another effective penetration mode of marketing the app is to use paid per click ads. Working in the same vein as organic clicks (website SEO), ads will be shown on user’s browsers when key words in their search criteria are matched to music event related stuff. 

Video: Creating a Youtube channel and using it to show snippets of event performances  will be a great way of getting notice from the public. Placing introduction videos of our app in before the start of those snippets will highlight to viewers the usefulness of our app. 

Traditional media: This would encompass placing advisements on television, radio and through print media (newspapers, mass flyers) to increase our app’s exposure to the public.
